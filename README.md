# iTerm Colour Palettes

This is a collection of 16-colour terminal palettes that I have gathered and/or modified from other colour schemes. I consider the colour *scheme* to be how these 16 colours are applied to different syntaxes, whereas the *palette* is the colours themselves. These are just the palettes, and they are meant to be used with Solarized colour schemes. That is, the 16 terminal colours are arranged in the following way:

Colour 0:  base02
Colour 1:  red
Colour 2:  green
Colour 3:  yellow
Colour 4:  blue
Colour 5:  pink
Colour 6:  cyan
Colour 7:  base2
Colour 8:  base03 (background)
Colour 9:  orange
Colour 10: base01
Colour 11: base00
Colour 12: base0 (foreground)
Colour 13: purple
Colour 14: base1
Colour 15: base3

For dark colour palettes, base03 is dark and base3 is light; for light colour palettes, base03 is light and base3 is dark. This means that you can switch the colour palette without having to change the underlying colour scheme. There are 8 colours and 8 greys, and are conceptually organized like this:

base03 (background)
base02 (less intense background)
base01
base00
base0 (foreground)
base1 (more intense foreground)
base2
base3

blue
cyan
green
purple
pink
red
orange
yellow

Some of these colour palettes come from existing schemes that do not conform to this arrangement. For these I have had to pick and choose from the available colours, and in some cases tweak or even create colours. iTerm requires a few other colours to be specified other than the 16 terminal colours. They have the following colours:

Foreground: base0 (Colour 12)
Background: base03 (Colour 8)
Bold: base1 (Colour 14)
Links: blue (Colour 4)
Selection: base0 (Colour 12)
Selected Text: base03 (Colour 8)
Cursor: base0 (Colour 12)
Cursor Text: base03 (Colour 8)

## Naming Convention

Dark palettes are just the name of the palette. Light palettes begin with an x (so that, in alphabetical order, they are bunched together), and the palette name has "Light" appended to it.
